Mac OS X
========
	xcodebuild -target OSX

will produce all OS X outputs. You have the choice between a "normal" 
dynamically linked framework MulleScion.framework or a shared library 
libMulleScion.a with a set of include headers.

It will also produce the mulle-scion executable.


iOS 1
=====
	xcodebuild -target iOS

to produce a shared library libMulleScion.a with a set of include headers.


iOS 2
=====

Get [https://github.com/kstenerud/iOS-Universal-Framework]() and
install "Real Framework". Then

	xcodebuild -target "MulleScion (iOS Framework)"

will produce a framework that you can add to your project. 


Tips
====

Avoid compile errors by using something like

	HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = $(inherited) $(PROJECT_DIR)/../MulleScion/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator

or when using the framework

	FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS = $(inherited) $(PROJECT_DIR)/../MulleScion/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator


Avoid runtime errors by using 

	OTHER_LDFLAGS = -ObjC

or something like

	OTHER_LDFLAGS = -force_load $(PROJECT_DIR)/lib/libMulleScion.a
