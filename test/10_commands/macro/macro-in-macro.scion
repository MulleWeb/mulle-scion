{# confusing re- and abuse of name as macro name and parameter,
   but it should just work
#} 
{% macro name( name, year) %}
{{ name }} {{ year }}
{% endmacro %}
{#
  because name() is now defined as a macro it will be replace in a macro
  call. The macro call happens at the time of parsage. Therefore 
  immediately at line 13
#}
{% macro stress( name) %}
{% name( year=name, name=@"VfL Bochum") %}
{% endmacro %}
{#
  expanded this reads now
   {{ @"VfL Bochum" }} {{ name }}
#}
{{ stress( @"1848") }}
