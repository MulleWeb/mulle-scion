You can concatenate strings in MulleScion with the '~' operator. `a ~ b` is
a shortcut for writing:

   [[a description] stringByAppendingString:[b description]]

with some added logic, if a is nil


#### Example

``` twig
{{ "VfL" ~ "Bochum" }} {{ 1848 }}
```

<cite>See [properties.plist](properties.plist) for the values used in this example.</cite>
