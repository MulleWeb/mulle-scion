A block marks marks a span of template content. It has an identifier.

{% block myblock %}Like so my block{% endblock %}

A block can share an identifier, but this is more often than not a mistake :)

{% block myblock %}Like this is so my other block{% endblock %}

On it's own a block contents are rendered as given into the template output. 
Only in conjunction with "extends" does the block reveal its true use.


Can block/endblock be used in multi-line statements ? Preferably not.
