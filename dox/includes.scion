Includes predicatably reads in another file. It's like copy/paste but 
MulleScion does the work for you. The contents are parsed just like
any regular template text.

There is a special includes called includes verbatim. It reads the contents of
a file but doesn't parse it.

Here we include set.scion and have the comments parsed away

{% includes "set.scion" %}

and the file included verbatim

{% includes verbatim "set.scion" %}

includes can't be used in multi-line statements.
