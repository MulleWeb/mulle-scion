`extends` is a special kind of [`includes`](/includes.scion?wrapper=_wrapper.scion).
After the file to extend has been opened, normal template parsing is suspended
and only blocks and other includes and extends statements are processed.

Whenever a [`block`](/includes.scion?wrapper=_wrapper.scion) is found in this state,
the block is recorded for later substitution of previously read blocks in the
non-suspended state. The last read block therefore wins. This in effect provides
a form of template inheritance.

Whenever another `extends` command is found. Regular template processing resumes
again, so that the extends command can perform an include (See first step).

General rule: After an ``extends``, there should be only other ``extends``and
``block`` definitions.  `extends` can't be used in multi-line statements.


#### Example 1

```
{% extends "__demo.scion" %}
{% block demo %}<blockquote>We override the contents</blockquote>{% endblock %}
```

The example shows how anything besides `block` and `extends` statements get
ignored. Because of the `extends` in Example 1, the example won't even show. And
the text you are reading is ignored by MulleScion as well.
