For those special moments, when you really want to do string operations in
the template and you need **NSRange**: there is a **NSMakeRange** function
built in.

#### Example

```
{{ [@"VfL Bochum 1848" substringWithRange:NSMakeRange( 4, 6)] }}
{# stupid pet tricks, achived by a category on NSValue #}
{{ [@"VfL Bochum 1848" rangeOfString:@"18"].location }}
```
