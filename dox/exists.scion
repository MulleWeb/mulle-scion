`exists` is a class, not a keyword. Currently it knows three methods
`any:`, `file:`, `directory:`. These methods test for existence of files or
directories on the file system.

This is a shortcut for
`[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:isDirectory:]`, which is
hard to use from mulle-scion.

#### Example

```
{% if not [exists file:"should-not-be-there.scion"] %}
A cherished file is missing!
{% endif %}
```
