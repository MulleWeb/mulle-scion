(written in an oldfashioned way)

This is the command-line tool for the [MulleScion](//github.com/MulleWeb/MulleScion)
library. It also provides the documentation for the project in a
self-contained webserver. It can use JSON, Plist, XML files, even multiples
and mixes, as a datasource for the template variables.
